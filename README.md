 

Technical Test

1.	Write a JavaScript function to get the last element of an array. Passing the parameter 'n' will return the last 'n' elements of the array.

2.	 Write a JavaScript program that accepts a number as input and inserts dashes (-) between each even number. For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8.

3.	Write a JavaScript program to flatten a nested (any depth) array. If you pass shallow, the array will only be flattened to a single level.
Sample Data :
console.log(flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]]));

4.	Write a JavaScript program to sort an array of JavaScript objects.
Sample Object :
var library = [ 
  {
       title:  'The Road Ahead',
       author: 'Bill Gates',
       libraryID: 1254
  
 },
   {
       title: 'Walter Isaacson',
       author: 'Steve Jobs',
       libraryID: 4264
   },
   {
  title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
       author: 'Suzanne Collins',
       libraryID: 3245
   }];

5.	Write a JavaScript function to get a copy of the object where the keys become the values and the values are the keys.
Example input-{red: "#FF0000", green: "#00FF00", white: "#FFFFFF"};
expected output-{"#FF0000":"red","#00FF00":"green","#FFFFFF":"white"}
